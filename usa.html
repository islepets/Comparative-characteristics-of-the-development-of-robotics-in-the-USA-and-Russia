            <p>
                "Mr. Telecox" (1928, American engineer J. Wensley) is a robot that had an external resemblance to a human, capable of performing elementary movements on a command given by voice, and became an exhibit at the World's Fair in New York.<br><br>
                "Eric" (1928) is a robot who gave a short speech at the Exhibition of the British Association of Modeling Engineers.The Naturalist (1928, under the direction of Dr. Nishimura Makota) is a Japanese robot capable of using an electric drive to manipulate hands and head. 
                Subsequently, this android was considered the ancestor of robotics in Japan.Alpha (1932, English inventor Harry May) is a humanoid automaton that sat down and stood up, moved his hands and spoke according to voice commands.<br><br>
                "Sabor" (Austrian inventor August Huber) – automata that were controlled by radio and could talk, walk, perform various manipulations.B2M (1936, Moscow schoolboy Vadim Matskevich) is the first android robot in Russia. 
                In 1937, he was awarded the diploma of the World's Fair in Paris.<br><br>The first computers in which the von Neumann principle was put into practice were Howard Aiken's Mark I electromagnetic relay circuit computer (1944) and the ENIAC electronic computer, developed in 1947 under the direction of J. R. R. Tolkien.

            <div class="article-title">The development of robotics in the 60s</div>
            <p>
                The emergence of modern robots should be attributed to 1959. This year, the first industrial manipulators with software control were created in the United States, which received the generally accepted name of industrial robots (OL) and marked the beginning of commercial production. 
                In the 50s of the XX century, a group of American engineers began working on the problem of applying control theory in solving general problems of optimal movement of equipment. The pioneers here were two talented American engineers– George K. Devol (1912-2011) and Joseph F. Engelberger (born in 1925).<br><br> 
                In 1954 . Devol patented in the USA a method for moving objects between different parts of the enterprise based on a control program on punched cards, similar to the one once proposed by Babbage. The invention was designed to solve, first of all, precisely the problem of flexibility, i.e. the creation of a universal transportation device that is easily reconfigurable to perform other operations.<a href="literature.html">[5]</a>
                In 1956. Devol, together with Engelberger, who worked at one of the aerospace companies at that time, organized the world's first robotics company "Unimation" ("Unimation"), which means "universal automation" – short for "Universal Automation", in the laboratory of this company, the world's first industrial robot was created according to Devol's patent, which was modest the name "programmable device for transferring objects" and became the prototype of subsequent developments.<br><br>
                In the early 1960s, the first American industrial robots with the trademarks "Unimate" and "Versatran", created respectively by the firms "Unimation", "American Machine and Foundry" (AMF) and designed to service technological processes, entered the industrial market. They were already quite advanced systems with feedback and a controlled trajectory of movement, had numerical control and memory, like a computer. Already in the first robots "Unimate" and "Versatran" the principle of programming by training was implemented.

            <p>
                In the 70s and 80s in the USA, robotics began to actively develop and be used in various industries and science. At this time, the first industrial robots appeared, capable of performing various tasks in production, such as welding, assembly, soldering and others. They have significantly increased productivity and product quality, as well as reduced the number of injuries among workers.  <br><br>
                In addition, in the 80s, autonomous robots capable of moving and performing tasks without human intervention began to be developed and used. This has opened up new opportunities for research in the fields of artificial intelligence, computer vision and machine learning.  <br><br>
                Also at this time, robotics research began to actively develop at universities and research centers in the United States. They were engaged in the creation of new control algorithms, mechanisms and sensors for robots, as well as their application in medicine, the defense industry, space and other fields.  <br><br>
                Thus, the development of robotics in the 70s and 80s in the USA was very intensive and had a huge impact on various spheres of human activity, from industry to science and education.

            <p>
                The modern development of robotics in the USA is one of the fastest growing and innovative in the world. Thanks to the active support of the government, scientific research and large technology companies, new achievements in the field of robotics are constantly emerging in the country.<br><br>
                One of the most discussed areas of robotics development in the United States is autonomous vehicles. Large companies such as Tesla, Waymo and Uber are investing millions of dollars in the development of self-driving cars and trucks. These technologies can influence the future of the transportation industry and change our way of life.<br>
                In addition, assistant robots are actively developing in the United States, which can help people in household chores, in the medical field, in manufacturing and other areas. Such robots make people's lives easier, help them with everyday tasks and increase productivity.<br><br>
                Robotics in the military sphere has also been actively developing in the United States in recent years. Military robots are used for mine clearance, reconnaissance, combat support and other tasks. These technologies can reduce risks for military personnel and increase the effectiveness of military operations.<br><br>
                In general, the modern development of robotics in the United States opens up huge opportunities and challenges for us. Robotics technologies can change our lives for the better, but they also pose important ethical and social issues that need to be taken into account when developing and using them.<br><br>
