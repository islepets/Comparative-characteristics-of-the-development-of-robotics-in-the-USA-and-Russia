            <p>
                In the 30s, one of the Soviet schoolchildren, Vadim Matskevich, created a robot that could move his right hand. The creation of the robot lasted 2 years, all this time the boy spent in the turning workshops of the Novocherkassk Polytechnic Institute. At the age of 12, Vadim was already distinguished by his ingenuity. 
                He created a radio-controlled small armored car that launched fireworks.

                Also during these years, automatic lines for processing bearing parts appeared, and then, in the late 40s, for the first time in the world, a comprehensive production of pistons for tractor engines was created.<br><br>
                 All processes have been automated: from loading raw materials to packaging products.
                In the late 40s, Soviet scientist Sergei Lebedev completed the development of the first electronic computing digital machine in the Soviet Union, MESM, which appeared in 1950. This computer has become the fastest in Europe.<br><br>
                 A year later, the Soviet Union issued an order on the development of automatic control systems for military equipment and the creation of a department of "Special robotics and mechatronics".

            <p>
                Since 1958, Soviet scientists began developing the world's first semiconductor AVM MN-10, which caused delight at an exhibition in New York.
                Cybernetic scientist Viktor Glushkov proposed the idea of creating "brain-like" computer structures combining billions of processors and combining data memory. In the late 50s, Soviet scientists managed to photograph the far side of the Moon using the Luna-3 station.
                The creation of the Lunokhod-1 spacecraft became one of the notable achievements of robotics in the USSR.<br><br>
                In 1962, a humanoid robot "REX" appeared in the Polytechnic Museum, conducting excursions for children.
                <a href="literature.html">[1]</a>
                In the late 60s and early 70s, there was a massive development of robots for industry in the Soviet Union, as well as the creation of underwater and military robots.
                In 1966, a manipulator for laying metal sheets was invented.<br><br>
                The Manta spacecraft became one of the first robots to explore the underwater world.
                In 1969, the creation of the industrial robot Universal-50 began.
                Automation has reached such a level that even in one of the ateliers a robot cutter was introduced to pattern and cut fabric according to the customer's size.

            <p>
                In the early 70s, many factories switched to automated production lines. One such example is the Petrodvorets Watch Factory "Raketa", which abandoned the manual assembly of mechanical watches and switched to robotic lines. 
                This made it possible to free more than 300 employees from tedious work and increase labor productivity by 6 times. The quality of the products has improved, and the number of defects has decreased.<br><br>
                The plant was awarded the Order of the Red Banner of Labor in 1971 for its advanced production.<a href="literature.html">[1]</a>
                In addition, in 1973, the first mobile industrial robots in the USSR, MP-1 and Octopus, were developed and put into production. 
                The state has allocated funds for the development and creation of serial industrial robots for servicing various production processes. Leningrad began to develop magnetic navigation systems for spaceships, submarines and airplanes.<br><br>
                In 1977, the symmetrical multiprocessor computing complex "Elbrus-1" was created, and in 1978 the catalog "Industrial Robots" was released. The number of complex mechanized and automated workshops and production facilities increased significantly from 1969 to 1979.
                Also at this time, revolutionary technologies in the field of computing systems and artificial intelligence were developed, including the first robot controlled by a learning neural network. In addition, a computer model of the 2nd generation was created - BESM-6, in which cache memory appeared for the first time.<br> 
                In 1979, an explosive ordnance disposal device, an ultralight mobile robot, was developed by order of the KGB.<a href="literature.html">[3]</a>

            <div class="article-title">The development of robotics in the 80s-90s</div>
            <p>
                In the 1980s, there was a rapid growth in the production of industrial robots in the USSR. About 40 new models have been developed, and work has begun on the standardization and unification of robots. 
                In 1980, the first pneumatic industrial robot with positional control was created. 
                The special feature of this robot was the use of MP-8 technical vision. The number of industrial robots in the USSR exceeded 6,000, which was more than 20% of the total number in the world by 1980.<br><br>
                In 1982, the USSR organized the international exhibition "Industrial Robots-82". In addition, a catalog was published in which robots were presented not only from the USSR, but also from other countries of the socialist camp. 
                In 1984, the active introduction of robots into production began. Flexible production modules (GPM), sites (GAU) and automated transport and storage systems (ATSS) were created.<br><br>
                The robots were monitored by a system of state standards, which was developed in 1985.
                However, with the collapse of the Soviet Union in the early 90s, plans for the development of robotics were interrupted, robot production was halted, and even existing models were destroyed. 
                The country switched to capitalism, which led to the cessation of the development of robotics in USSR.<a href="literature.html">[8]</a>

            <div class="article-title">Robotics in modern Russia</div>
            <p>
                At this stage, Russian robotics is based more on foreign basic research with a focus on the external market, since the capacity of the domestic Russian market is still insignificant and for the sustainable development of domestic developers and manufacturers of robotic systems it is necessary to focus on foreign markets. 
                Robotics is traditionally divided by the international robotics Federation (IFR) into service and industrial robotics. Currently, the first type of robotics prevails in Russia, which can be seen by the number of companies belonging to these types: 80 companies developing service robots against 10 industrial ones.<br><br> 
                Thanks to the SWOT analysis of the robotics market in Russia the main competitive advantages of the country were identified, among which, for example, one can note the huge territories and small population. Due to this situation, the use of unmanned transport (air, land, sea and river) in our country can be justified and cost-effective.<br><br> 
                As a result, driverless transport on our routes can be used for commercial purposes a little earlier than in countries with higher population density. It is also worth noting the threats that arise in the way of the development of domestic robotics. In the first place among the main ones are geopolitical barriers: the current sanctions regime against the Russian Federation puts barriers on scientific and technical cooperation with foreign specialists, prevents the import of technologies and blocks access to international investment.
                It is also worth noting the increase in the trend
